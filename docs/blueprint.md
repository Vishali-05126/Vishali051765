# **App Name**: Synergistic Learning Accelerator

## Core Features:

- Neural Learning Pattern Mapping: Analyze typing patterns and mouse movements to detect learner's flow state and cognitive load.
- Reverse Teaching Protocol: AI learns from the student, deliberately injecting mistakes for students to correct, tracking confusion for visual mapping. Uses LLM reasoning as a tool for when to inject such errors.
- Multi-Persona Learning Ensemble: Present concepts through multiple AI personalities, debating and explaining from different angles, moderated by the student.
- Failure Simulation Playground: Provide a safe environment where AI simulates realistic failure scenarios, analyzing patterns and predicting errors.
- Predictive Knowledge Gaps: Simulate future skills, compares them to career path needs, forecasts skill decay and recommends learning based on the gap.
- Hyper-Personalized Anti-Patterns: Identify personal learning anti-patterns, providing intervention and energy-optimized scheduling. The intervention micro-moments are selected via a tool powered by generative AI.
- Skill Ancestry Display: Show evolutionary path of skills, visualizing connections from basic knowledge to the current knowledge. Allow the student to compare knowledge domains.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7) to reflect intelligence and creativity.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F5), providing a neutral backdrop for content.
- Accent color: Teal (#009688), for interactive elements and highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, offering a modern look suitable for headlines or body text.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use clean, geometric icons representing various learning modules and tools.
- Subtle transitions and micro-interactions to provide feedback and maintain user engagement.
